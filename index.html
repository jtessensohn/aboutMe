        <p>My name is Jared. I was born in Houston and have lived in the area most of my life. 
            I have worked four years in the service industry working at both a local pizzeria and a Best Buy.
            I played the French Horn for seven years and have since picked up the bass guitar as a slow-going hobby.
            I also enjoy:
